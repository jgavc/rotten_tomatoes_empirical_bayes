# Research Motivation & Question

Lets say you want to watch a movie at home, how should you decide on what movie is best?

An idea would be checking a movie review site to see what is reviewed best. Rotten Tomatoes provides the percentage of critic and audience reviews that enjoyed a movie enough to give it a "fresh" rating. What movies have the highest tomatometer?

Hmm, I've never heard of these movies before. Let's take a look at 'Twas the Fight Before Christmas. Maybe its the next Christmas Story.

Immediately we see an issue with relying solely on the tomatometer, it can be a perfect 100% if only a few critics have given favorable reviews.

How can we create a metric that lets us find and compare movies in a fair way? Empirical Bayes provides a solution!

# Data Overview

The data for this analysis has been kindly scraped by Stefano Leone who has shared this data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset). It provides us with data from Rotten Tomatoes for 17,000 movies up to the end of 2020. For each movie we have the number of critics and audience who reviewed a movie and the percentage who reviewed them as fresh, exactly what we need to perform this analysis.

# Constructing a Prior

Empirical Bayes approaches are very helpful for situations where the statistic of interest is a proportion and our goal is to compare the "true" proportions after adjusting for known information about movie reviews. Since we want to choose the best movie, and tomatometer is a percentage of reviews, and we have a large number of movies (17,000) this method is perfect

The first step is to take a look at the distribution of tomatometer for movies with a certain breakpoint of critic reviews.

```{r, filtered movies}
reduced_movies <- movie_df |> 
  mutate(p = tomato_meter_fresh_critics_count / tomatometer_count) |> 
  filter(tomatometer_count > 50)
```

```{r, fig 1}
reduced_movies |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = tomatometer_count)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

```{r}
reduced_movies <- filtered_movie_df |> filter(tomatometer_count > 50)
p <- reduced_movies$tomato_meter_fresh_critics_count / reduced_movies$tomatometer_count
p <- p[is.finite(p)]

hist(p, breaks = 40, freq = FALSE, main = "Proportions with Beta Mixture Overlay", xlab = "fresh / total")
curve(mix_beta_density(x, mm$pi, mm$alpha, mm$beta), add = TRUE, lwd = 2)
```
